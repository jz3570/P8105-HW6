#### Problem 2

```{r}
homicide <- read.csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")%>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  unite(city_state, c(city,state),sep = ", ") %>% 
  mutate(solved = case_when(grepl("Closed by arrest", disposition)==TRUE ~ 1,
  grepl("Closed by arrest", disposition)==FALSE ~ 0)) %>% 
  mutate(unsolved = case_when(grepl("Closed by arrest", disposition)==FALSE ~ 1,
  grepl("Closed by arrest", disposition)==TRUE ~ 0)) %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(city_state, "Dallas, TX"))%>% 
  filter(!str_detect(city_state, "Phoenix, AZ"))%>% 
  filter(!str_detect(city_state, "Kansas City, MO"))%>% 
  filter(!str_detect(city_state, "Tulsa, AL"))%>% 
  filter(str_detect(victim_race, c("White", "Black"))) %>% 
  mutate(victim_age =as.numeric(victim_age))%>% 
  na.omit()
BMD = filter(homicide,city_state=="Baltimore, MD")
fit_logistic = BMD%>% 
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial())
fit_logistic %>% 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate), adj.conf.low=exp(conf.low), adj.conf.high=exp(conf.high)) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value, adj.conf.low, adj.conf.high, conf.low, conf.high) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
exp(summary(fit_logistic)$coefficients["victim_sexMale",1] + qnorm(c(0.025,0.5,0.975)) * summary(fit_logistic)$coefficients["victim_sexMale",2])
```
Keeping all other variables fixed, the estimate of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims is 0.4687305, with confidence interval of (0.3193133, 0.6880650).

```{r}
city_glm = 
  homicide %>%
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(model = map(data, ~glm(solved~victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial())),
         result = map(.x=model, ~broom::tidy(.x,conf.int = TRUE))) %>% 
  select( city_state,result)%>% 
  unnest(result)%>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate), adj.conf.low=exp(conf.low), adj.conf.high=exp(conf.high)) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value, adj.conf.low, adj.conf.high) 

```
